# Facial Recognition & Lie Detector AI

## Overview

This project utilizes Artificial Intelligence (AI) to perform facial recognition and detect deception based on microexpressions and physiological signals. It integrates deep learning models and computer vision techniques to analyze facial patterns and determine the likelihood of deceptive behavior.

## Features

- **Facial Recognition**: Identifies and verifies individuals based on facial features.
- **Lie Detection**: Analyzes microexpressions, eye movement, and other non-verbal cues to detect potential deception.
- **Real-time Processing**: Uses advanced AI models for real-time video analysis.
- **Cross-platform Compatibility**: Can be used on Windows, macOS, and Linux.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Simple and intuitive UI for seamless user experience.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**
- **OpenCV** (for image processing)
- **TensorFlow/Keras** (for deep learning models)
- **Dlib** (for facial landmark detection)
- **MediaPipe** (for facial tracking)
- **Flask/FastAPI** (for API development)

## Installation

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.8+
- pip

### Setup

```sh
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/facial-ai-lie-detector.git
cd facial-ai-lie-detector

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run the application
python main.py
```

## Usage

1. Start the application.
2. Upload or enable the webcam for facial recognition.
3. The system will analyze facial expressions and predict deception likelihood.
4. Results will be displayed in real-time.
