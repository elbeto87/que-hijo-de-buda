# Facial Recognition & Lie Detector AI

## Overview

This project utilizes Artificial Intelligence (AI) to perform facial recognition and detect deception based on microexpressions and physiological signals. It integrates deep learning models and computer vision techniques to analyze facial patterns and determine the likelihood of deceptive behavior.

## Features

- **Facial Recognition**: Identifies and verifies individuals based on facial features.
- **Lie Detection**: Analyzes microexpressions, eye movement, and other non-verbal cues to detect potential deception.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**
- **OpenCV** (for image processing)
- **TensorFlow** (for deep learning models)
- **DeepFace** (for facial analysis)
- **Whisper** (for audio processing)

## Installation

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.12+

### Setup

```sh
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/elbeto87/que-hijo-de-buda.git
cd que-hijo-de-buda

poetry install

# Run the application
python main https://<YOUTUBE_LINK>
```

## Usage

1. Start the application by running the `main.py` script.
2. Provide the YouTube link of the video you want to analyze.
3. The application will process the video and display the results.
